This project is a portfolio that to showcase my photography works. The sole function is to be a fairly fancy dynamic website for the aforementioned purpose.

The frontend should have a index page or a list of my works, and the backend should contain login, admin, and edit functions. 

Currently I have a demo login page, demo edit page, and a demo post page set. However I am still in early stages for the home page and the admin panel.

The files are of following:
- `assets` folder for some statc assets used by my chosen HTML starter templates, including CSS, JS, and a Favicon file
- `media` currently holds some of the media files used in my demo post page, which will probably end up in a database or CDN bucket later
- `boilerplate_materialize.html` is the starter template for the "Materialize" front-end framework, which will be used for the public-facing display pages
- `boilerplate_skeleton.html` is the starter template for the "Skeleton" front-end framework, which will be used for my non-public-facing admin pages
- `adminpanel.html` is the start of a admin panel
- `edit.html` is the start of a post editor
- `index.html` is the start of the home page
- `login.html` is a demo login page
- `post.html` is a demo post
