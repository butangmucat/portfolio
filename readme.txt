This project is a portfolio that to showcase my photography works. The sole function is to be a fairly fancy dynamic website for the aforementioned purpose.

The frontend should have a index page or a list of my works, and the backend should contain login, admin, and edit functions. 

Working:

- MongoDB backend (store)
- Create Post

Doesn't work:

- Show post
- Upload file

Todo:

- Show posts in admin panel and index page
